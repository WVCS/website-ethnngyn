    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p> Hello, my name is Ethan Nguyen and by June 9, 2023, I would have already graduated from Westview High School. Throughout my four years in high school, I was not only able to develop academically as a student, but I was also able to become a better human being as I constantly seeked self-improvement. Now that I am no longer a high schooler, I will continue on with my academic journey to UCR and plan to enter pre-med. However, I'm not too sure if I want to stay all four years in order to obtain my bachelor's or if I'm planning to transfer to another UC. </p>
